# I never knew a website could hurt someone

Accessibility is not just about blind people using screen users

Assistive technologies come in different versions. Some may be hardware some may be software.

- Keyboard overlays for low-vision users.
- trackball for people with motor control limitations
- Magnifier for low-vision
- Language cards

## The 'user' is a person

They existed before their session on your site and will continue to exist after.

## Some disabilities are invisible

"...you just pray that they believe that the tears in your swollen eyes are real"

Pains effects aren't just physical

National Pain Foundation
- talk aloud protocol
- they 'bitched' the whole time
- talking about their problems - how hard it was to live with their disease
- medication or pain]
- no completed the task the site was utter shit.
- your design can literally hurt them.

### Attempting to interact with a poorly designed and inaccessible website can actually hurt your users

- lethargy
- weakness
- mood disorders
-

**THE USER WANT TO KNOW**

- where am I?
- What can i do here?
- How do i do that?

### The principle of Least Astonishment

the results of performing some operations should be obvious, consistent and predictable from looking at the code.

### POUR

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

**Obvious always wins** - @lukew

-  your way-finding painfully obvious.
- Let users recover from their errors

**What is this thing. What does it do**

- What are the goals of the user?
- What are the goals of the business
- How would this ui element contribute to both goals
- How is this UI element better for the user than the competing options?

- How does it operate via the mouse
- how does this control operate via keyboard
- somethings about focus

Good design is the convergance between creativity and capability
