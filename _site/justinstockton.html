<ul>
  <li>how were these decision going to effect page load times below 2 seconds?</li>
  <li>what are non-funcitonal requirements?</li>
  <li>how do work a11y into those decisions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-non-functional-requirements">What are non-functional requirements?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>they define the size of the box</li>
  <li>the canvas decides how big the picture will base</li>
  <li>those constraints define how we’re going to build</li>
  <li>as an artist you work within the scope of the canvas</li>
  <li>don’t think of constaints as limiting, think of them..</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a11y-vs-other-non-functional-requirements">a11y vs. other non-functional requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>a11y is context oriented</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accessibility &amp; Security</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Security is usually the loudest voice in the room</li>
  <li>Both have legal and financial ramifications</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Common Conflicts</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Timing Adjustments (2.2.1)</li>
  <li>Error Identification (3.3.1)</li>
  <li>Error Suggestion (3.3.3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accessibility &amp; Performance</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Page load and rendering time cascade down to the a11y tree</li>
  <li>Utilize native components where possible</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Common conflicts</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Meaningful Sequence (1.3.2)</li>
  <li>Keyboard (2.1.1)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accessibility &amp; Usability</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Two sides of the same coin</li>
  <li>Possible to make something usable, but not accessible and vice-versa</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Common Conflicts</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>On Focus (3.2.1)</li>
  <li>On Input (3.2.2)</li>
  <li>Error Identification (3.3.1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you’re aware what is happening to gauge the a11y requirements. It may help some users but could harm a11y.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility &amp; Maintainability</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan for tomorrow today because your time is money</li>
  <li>Document the <strong>why</strong> not just the <strong>what</strong></li>
  <li>Invest in pattern and component library</li>
  <li>Automate as many test as you can</li>
</ul>

<p>Developers want to try new things. They want to push the limits of technology. We can’t hold them back so we have to rely on what we know to apply those to the technologies.</p>

<p>The more you can invest in components, the easier it is to maintain a11y. This helps lower the bar for successful.</p>

<p>Use different tools to test your site. Examine the difference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a11yenhancer.js</li>
  <li>a11y modal</li>
  <li>we need to create more standardized components!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing…</h2>

<p>Get the definition of ready. And get the definition of done.</p>

<p><strong>definition of done</strong>
- acceptance criteria
- concept of minimum viable product - a way of managing the risk associated with the project. Limiting the investment in a product that may never work.</p>

<p>How does the relate to a11y? You want to focus on making sure all of those constrains are baked in the from the start. Use prototypes - especially for really complex things. If we can identify that one of our constraints will effect it. See how it might work. Test it outside of the system.</p>

<p>Test it with assistive technology. Test it with an expert in assistive technology.</p>

<p>The Definition Done reflects back on the definition of ready.</p>

<p>Think about the consequences.</p>
