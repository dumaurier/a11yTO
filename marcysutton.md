# Technical Accessibility

- you can use your technical skills to break down barriers
- using pragmatic a11y development for good
- #developForGood

- Accessible controls
- focus management
- dialogs
- Also - using the command line
- Debugging in the browser
- Test coverage
- Promises

Test coverage provides a developer contract for a how a feature should work and prevents regression from going out the door. **Break the build if a test failed**

Create healthier software development

### Test coverage
- unit tests
- integration tests
- end to end tests
- Protractor &amp; Selenium Web Driver

### Demos

**New York Times**

- Major a11y problems
- buttons aren't operable
- using Divs instead of buttons
- Buttons become Focusable

**Karma**

- JS Test runner
- Grunt - task runner
- Jasmine - write test and describe what they should do

Write tests to make sure accessible elements are being used.

**Use a dialog element for modal**

*Requires Polyfill*

## Removing barriers

- use real buttons
- wire the esc key
- dialog focus management
- inert Polyfill
- write testable code
